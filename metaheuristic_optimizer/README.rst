Metaheuristic_Optimizer
=======================
         
Metaheuristic_Optimizer is a collection of metaheuristic optimization algorithms for Python (any version: Python 2, Python 3, Pypy 2 and Pypy 3).

It contains algorithms for nonlinear optimization and ordering optimization (such as TSP, traveling salesman problem).

Included algorithms:

 - Artificial Feeding Birds (AFB) (nonlinear and ordering)

 - Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) (nonlinear)
   
 - Firefly Algorithm (FA) (nonlinear)

 - Random-key-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) (ordering)
   
 - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) (ordering)

   
Metaheuristic_Optimizer has been created by Jean-Baptiste Lamy at the LIMICS reseach lab.
It is available under the GNU LGPL licence v3.
